I'd like to start building out a fictitious world in which to base the stories I'd _eventually_ like to write.

In this section, we'll do that, divided out into the following major areas:

The world I'm most interested in developing is very similar to our own universe (as most critically are) but has a few major differences resulting from an advanced civilization that existed and fell within the last 10,000 years.

- [[areas.writing.the-universe.history]] covers the major events that have unfolded in the distant past of this universe.
- [[areas.writing.the-universe.characters]] covers major and minor characters. There will be many people shaping this world.
- [[areas.writing.the-universe.cities]] This world is fairly _new_ and larger continent-spanning organization has not developed yet. Advanced cities have sprung up fairly recently.
- [[areas.writing.the-universe.forces]] covers the novel elements that pervade this world. From the advanced cores that can power devices for many lifetimes to the advanced djinn that inhabit devices of power.
- [[areas.writing.the-universe.culture]] the customs and rituals that the people of this world celebrate.
- [[areas.writing.the-universe.factions]] describes the competing groups jockeying for power and prestige.
- [[areas.writing.the-universe.wildlife]] describes the plants and animals that share the world.
