## Week 1

Generate 5 ideas:

- From an interview or conversation you’ve had
- From research you’ve done (reading science news, military history, etc)
- From observation (go for a walk!)
- From a piece of media (watch a movie)
- From a piece of music (with or without lyrics)

### Idea 1:
This story takes place in a post great-filter world where lots of the technology humans invented have been lost in time. However, people had enough technology that the stuff they did create lasted a long time. Many basic technologies were also preserved because the only people that survived had to live in bunkers towards the middle of the countries. Bangalore was obviously one of the more important cities in this future since it's situated on a plateau. 
In this harsh land, city states run supreme. There aren't that many people but the technology they have left does lend itself to centralization. Rural areas have been destroyed mostly - the world is pretty wild with harsh deserts, jungles and tundras. The only people who live outside of the cities are restless nomads who have been able to get their hands on a "power core". These have been discovered over time and passed down across families.

Through this, a new threat arises as a the city states across the world start going dark due to the influence of a nearby planetary civilization. 

### Idea 2:
A religious city state with many differing interpretations of their sacred comes into contact with a miltaristic one with dire consequences. However both must ally with each other when faced with the threat of a culture that ritually burns their history and promotes self-improvement at all costs. 

In the end, while one of the cultures "wins", it merely strengthens it's own opposition, leading to a struggle for supremacy of all 3 states. 


### Idea 3:
A dark comedy where a woman pirate must navigate the seas with a crew. She starts by herself and overthrows the captain when he is found incapable of managing a crew. She's forced to leave him and his close compatriots at the next port. Her biggest supporter is a formerly infamous naval captain who now serves on the ship due to money troubles. 

She builds up a crew and then takes down the power structures in her home country that lead her to take to a life of crime. 

### Idea 4:
A master craftsman must come to terms with his mortality when after creating his finest work of art, feels like committing suicide. Leads to him discovering love in the arms of a former student who, while not a natural satirist, excels as an accountant. She starts supporting the both of them. While initially devotional, the master accountant must lead the former artist through the pains of living a regular life, devoid of calling. 

Once that's done, they both produce the most beautiful work of historical fiction known to their generation. 

### Idea 5:

A former child celebrity discovers their passions as a product manager in the company that built the platform they got famous on. Both company and child star are at a low point with numerous scandals in their distant past. They struggle for relevance in a post-apocalyptic world. 

Eventually, this middle-aged product manager leads a stunning cultural shift at the company that finally bankrupts their corrupt investors while leading to a scientific breakthrough that shows promise at ending the cycle of strife facing this world.
