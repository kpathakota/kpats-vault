# Lecture 1

Form good writing habits. Find the hours you need per week - that's _the_ most important thing. About 2K words a week gets you a book in a year.

Form a writing group.

- Workshoppee shouldn't respond to feedback and should write everything down.
- Workshoppers should always say what's working and be descriptive rather than prescriptive.
