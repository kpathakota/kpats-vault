- [The site](https://poignant.guide/)

methods just pass messages between variables (the arguments) and the variable that is calling the message i.e. pipe.catch_a_star.

nil means the variable is empty. empty_cup = nil.

on a single line, ruby can use if statements. _unless_ is also a reserved keyword and is the inverse of if (only executes the line if the condition is false or nil)

Everything returns something. Even the if statement returns the last executed statement.

.nil? asks any variable if it's nil.

Use double quotes " " if the string has single quotes within it.

Dictionary -
CODE_WORDS = {'a' => 10, 'b' => 20}

Within a block, you have things called block variables, denoted by | a , b|. Still need to learn more about them.

For ruby, just use the + keyword for string concat.

Dir::[] is the same as Dir[]. It's a class method shortcut. Same with
CODE_WORDS.[]('hi') is the same as CODE_WORDS['hi']
