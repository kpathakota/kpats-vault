- Disorders are just reality being more complex than our mental models.

Trickle down economics has been a strawman this whole time! It's actually a behavioral change that's expected in terms of taxes paid (rich people no longer invest in tax-exempt securities). It increases the tax revenue in this way. Thus cutting taxes is not expecting a post-income expenditure increase but instead expects a direct increase in taxes paid by the wealthy.

Another way to thing about this is the tax cuts go directly to workers because when you cut taxes, people are more likely to start business which require up-front capital which gets distributed immediately. The profits (which are taxed) come later so you're actually deferring profits.
